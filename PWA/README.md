# Vue.js Progressive Web App

Our Progressive Web App (PWA) is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) off of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

The packages our PWA uses are managed with NPM.js(https://www.npmjs.com/).

Our PWA uses [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) built on top of wepback for rapid development.
